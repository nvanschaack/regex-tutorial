@: Matches the '@' symbol.

([\da-z\.-]+): Matches one or more occurrences of digits, lowercase letters, dot, or hyphen after the '@' symbol in the domain name.

\.: Matches a literal dot '.'.

([a-z\.]{2,6}): Matches between 2 to 6 occurrences of lowercase letters or dots for the top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org).
