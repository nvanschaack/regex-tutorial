## Description
This is a GitHub gist meant to simplify a regular expression, or regex, for an email search pattern. A regular expression is code used to see if a users input **matches** the correct structure of a certain type of input. For example, there should be an '@' symbol and a certain amount of characters afterwards and then should end in a '.com' or '.edu' in any given email address. A regular expression can help make sure those types of characters or strings are present when they are included in your code.
